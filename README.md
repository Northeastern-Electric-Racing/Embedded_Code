## Introduction
If you're new here, make sure to complete all the steps from [this onboarding document](https://github.com/Northeastern-Electric-Racing/Embedded_Code/blob/ndepatie-dev/docs/onboarding.md). It'll basically run you through the basics of git and setting up git on your system, installing VSCode and PlatformIO, and some basics of functions and objects in C++.


## System Overview of Car
A simple diagram of the system can be seen in the UML diagram below. [Here is a more in-depth explanation of how everything works](https://github.com/Northeastern-Electric-Racing/Embedded_Code/blob/ndepatie-dev/docs/carchitecture.md).

## System Overview of Car
The computer architecture of the car consists of 4 "nodes", and each node communicates to eachother by sending messages along the CAN bus. CAN, or controller area network, is an industry standard communication protocol, especially used for large system applications, such as automotive and robotics. Think of the car's version of LAN (Local area network). The hardware of the CAN bus is two lines, a CAN High line and a CAN Low line with 120 ohm resistors at the end of the lines and each . This is why some people call it two wire communication. A simple diagram of the system can be seen in the UML diagram below.

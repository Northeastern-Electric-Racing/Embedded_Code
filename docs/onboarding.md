## Introduction to the basics of embedded code development
By the end of this list, you should be in a place where you are more than ready to start work on the car. A lot of this stuff you might have already done
or don't need to do if you've dabbled in software development before, but if you're fresh out of cornerstone you might need to go step by step. Go through
at your own discretion, but each step is pretty important.

1. [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join)
2. [Follow this tutorial on the basics of using Git in the CLI](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-git-in-under-10-minutes-da548267cc91/)
3. Clone whatever repository you're going to be working in

i.e. if I want to clone the ```Embedded_Code``` repo, I'd go to the green "Code" button above the file structure in the repository and copy the link, so it would be

```git clone git@github.com:Northeastern-Electric-Racing/Embedded_Code.git``` 

4. Learn some coding basics

Now that may seem kinda stupid, but there's always tricks and wyas of formatting code that you can learn. For the code on the car, we use C++ for everything, and
we use an object-oriented framework to organize all the code into header ```.h``` files and source ```.cpp``` files. As of now, we use Python for most telemetry
applications and scripts, and we use objects in them too. Below are a few tutorials based on what you're going to be doing in the club to work through at your own leisure
(don't feel too pressured to finish it all in one night, but they are really good resources, especially if you only need to focus on the later class based stuff)


#### If you're interested in learning Python and coding higher level applications...
***[try to walk through this tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp)***
If you do all the exercises you'll get a pretty good understanding of Python


#### If you're interested in learning C++ and lower level embedded code...
***[try to walk through this tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/default.asp)***
This should lay the groundwork for coding with objects, constructors, pointers, etc, especially if you do the exercises for the stuff you don't know. The code really
resembles Arduino code at a base level
